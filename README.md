## User Story

Jake wants to go catch a train from Ellerslie to Auckland CBD for a fun night out with his friends. 
However, like many other disabled New Zealanders, Jake finds that the preparation for this kind of event is often “complicated, unpredictable, expensive, and time-consuming” 
This is because he would have to consider many different factors including how near public toilets are to him when he arrives in Auckland CBD.

Let’s go back to Jack who has recently discovered AccessMap. By opening AccessMap on his smartphone Jake is not only able to visualise his journey to the CBD, but also can better understand what are some of the facilities which are well suited to his needs. He can now make his way to the CBD with a sense of comfort.
